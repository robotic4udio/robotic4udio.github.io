Have you ever imagined creating music from nature itself? At an alternative sound experiment workshop in Vordingborg, we did exactly that! Using innovative technology and a deep appreciation for unconventional sound sources, participants built unique instruments from organic materials—transforming the environment into a musical playground.

From stringed instruments crafted from wood found in the forest to a Bela-based sound device made from branches mounted onto another wooden piece, the workshop was an exploration of the limitless potential of sound. Attendees experimented with resonance, texture, and structure, discovering how different natural materials could generate rich, dynamic tones.

One of the highlights was a carrot instrument, where vegetables were wired up to generate sound, demonstrating the surprising musical potential of everyday organic objects. Additionally, percussion instruments were crafted from found materials, including used bottles from the festival, which were repurposed into rhythm-makers, adding a sustainable and improvisational element to the performance.

TV2 Øst visited the festival and made a small feature on the workshop. You can watch it [here](https://www.tv2east.dk/vordingborg/goer-stroem-i-guleroedder-til-musik-alternativ-havefest-laver-musik-med-groentsager).

This approach to music-making resonates deeply with our philosophy at Robotic Audio, where we merge technology, sound, and creativity to push the boundaries of music and interaction. Just like in this workshop, we explore the fusion of organic and electronic elements to develop new sonic possibilities. Our work with custom-built electronic instruments, sensor-driven interfaces, and experimental sound design mirrors the ingenuity behind transforming raw materials into expressive musical tools.

Beyond the novelty, workshops like these challenge perceptions of what music can be. They inspire fresh perspectives on technology, sustainability, and the boundless creativity of sound exploration. As experimental music makers, we love seeing projects that push the boundaries of composition and performance.

So, the next time you take a walk in the woods, listen closely—there might be music waiting to be discovered!
