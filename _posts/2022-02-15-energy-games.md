I collaborated with [Bue & Co.](https://www.bueogco.dk/) to create the Energi-games, interactive energy-themed installations for clients [Affald Plus](https://affaldplus.dk/yderzonen), [Norfors](https://norfors.dk/besog/velkommen/), and [Refa](https://www.refa.dk/academy/book-et-besoeg/). Each game is a bit different -- based on the client requirements -- but they all educate users on energy creation, distribution, and consumption optimization. 

The game lets players manage energy production, distribution, and consumption in a model cityâ€”making complex energy concepts engaging and hands-on. Players manage the power plant's furnace, handle combustible materials, prioritize and allocate energy, and ensure the city's electricity and district heating needs are met. The game's values and scenarios closely mirror real-life situations. 

ðŸ”¹ [Bue & Co.](https://www.bueogco.dk/) designed and built the detailed model city, bringing the visual world to life.
ðŸ”¹ I developed and implemented the electronics and interactive gameplay, creating a dynamic system that controls lights, windmills, and other moving elements in real-time.

## Educational benefits

Players are challenged to think critically and make decisions that balance energy production with consumption needs, mirroring the complexities faced by real energy managers. This educational tool promotes a deeper understanding of energy systems and encourages sustainable practices among younger generations.

Beyond its educational benefits, the Energy Game also promotes teamwork and problem-solving skills, as players collaborate to achieve common goals. The immersive experience is both fun and informative, making it an effective way to teach essential concepts related to energy and sustainability.
