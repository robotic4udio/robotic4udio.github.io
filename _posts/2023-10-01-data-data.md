[DATA-DATA](https://www.teaterfantast.dk/data-data/) is a danish theater production that explores the history and evolution of computers, artificial intelligence, and our relationship with technology. Created in collaboration with [Teater Fantast](https://www.teaterfantast.dk/), [Science & Cocktails](https://www.scienceandcocktails.org/), AI researcher [Thomas Bolander](https://www.thomas-bolander.dk/), and theoretical physicist [Jay Armas](https://jacomearmas.org/), the performance merges science, storytelling, and digital elements to bring the world of computing to life.

## My Role – Composer & Sound Designer
As composer and sound designer for [DATA-DATA](https://www.teaterfantast.dk/data-data/), I was - together with Anders Bo Erikson - responsible for crafting a musical universe that reflected the transformation of technology—from early mechanical computation to the complexity of modern AI.

The music and sound design played a crucial role in shaping the audience’s experience by:
- Composing an original score that blended electronic textures, glitch aesthetics, and cinematic elements to enhance the storytelling.
- Designing dynamic soundscapes that underscored key moments in the performance, emphasizing the evolution of computing and its societal impact.
- Creating an interplay between music and the humanoid robot featured in the performance, reinforcing the show’s exploration of human-machine interaction.
- Music as a Narrative Element

Rather than serving as a mere background element, the music in [DATA-DATA](https://www.teaterfantast.dk/data-data/) was an integral part of the storytelling. The sound design evolved throughout the performance, symbolizing the shift from rigid, structured early computing to the fluid, unpredictable nature of modern AI.

We composed music in a variety of styles due to the historical scope of the performance, ranging from mechanical, repetitive motifs to orchestral big-band arrangements.

## Beyond the Stage – Educational Impact
As part of DATA-DATA, an educational program was developed for middle and high school students in collaboration with researcher Sine Zambach. The material explores topics like algorithms, data ethics, and artificial intelligence, encouraging students to critically engage with the digital world.

## An Immersive Experience
[DATA-DATA](https://www.teaterfantast.dk/data-data/) was more than just a theater production—it was an artistic and intellectual journey into the digital age. Through my work as a composer and sound designer, I helped create an atmospheric and evocative soundscape that connected the audience emotionally to the themes of technology, progress, and our relationship with machines.
