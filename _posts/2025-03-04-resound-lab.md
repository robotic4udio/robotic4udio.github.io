### **ReSound Lab – Giving Waste a Second Life Through Sound**  

In a world overflowing with discarded technology, ReSound Lab transforms waste into unique musical instruments, exploring the intersection of sound art, sustainability, and technological innovation. By repurposing obsolete hardware—such as hard drives, circuit boards, printer components, CRT-TV's and industrial machinery—through hacking, reprogramming, and mechanical manipulation, this project gives new meaning to what is often considered trash.

> “One man’s trash is another man’s instrument.

Each year, millions of tons of electronic waste (e-waste) are discarded globally, much of it ending up in landfills or shipped to developing countries, where it poses severe environmental and health risks.  ReSound Lab challenges this cycle by transforming abandoned materials into instruments and compositions, turning obsolete technology into creative expression. Read more about the [global e-waste crisis](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/20/climate/electronic-waste-recycling-climate-un/index.html).

By blending DIY instrument building, sound art, and sustainability, ReSound Lab uncovers the hidden sonic potential of electronic waste. Using contact microphones, electromagnetic pickups, circuit augmentation, sensors, and digital processing, we reveal the rhythms and textures buried within discarded hardware.


### **ReSound Lab – A Collective in the Making**  
At this stage, **ReSound Lab is still in its idea phase**, and I am looking to build a **collective of artists, musicians, makers, and hackers** who share a passion for experimental sound and sustainability. The goal is not only to create and perform with upcycled electronic instruments but also to form a **band that explores the musical potential of discarded technology**.  

💡 **Interested in being part of ReSound Lab?**  
If this project resonates with you, don’t hesitate to reach out! Whether you want to contribute ideas, build instruments, or join the collective as a performer, your input and creativity are more than welcome.  

#### Members of ReSound Lab
Currently ReSound Lab consists of: 
- [Hjalte Bested Hjorth (Robotic-Audio)](https://roboticaudio.com/about): Founder and initiator of the project. I am a composer, sound artist, robotics engineer, and creative technologist with a background in music composition, sound design, and interactive installations. My work merges art and technology, creating immersive experiences that push creative and technical boundaries.
- [Jens Erik Larson (JEL Instruments)](https://www.jelinstruments.com/#about_me): Is a skilled instrument builder and musician with a background in lutherie, electronics, and experimental sound. He has a passion for creating unique instruments and exploring the boundaries of sound design.
- [Anders Bo Erikson (Opica)](https://www.discogs.com/artist/9953923-Opica): Is a versatile musician and innovative producer, known for seamlessly blending acoustic and electronic soundscapes. Proficient in a range of instruments—including the cimbalom/dulcimer, percussion, and tuba—he combines his instrumental expertise with the limitless sonic possibilities of digital production.


### **Why It Matters**  
By giving new purpose to discarded materials, **ReSound Lab**:  

♻️ **Reduces Waste** – Diverts electronic components from landfills and repurposes them into functional instruments.  
🌍 **Raises Awareness** – Highlights the global e-waste crisis and promotes sustainable alternatives.  
🎵 **Expands Musical Boundaries** – Introduces new sonic possibilities through unconventional sound sources.  
🔧 **Encourages DIY & Maker Culture** – Inspires others to experiment with upcycling and creative reuse.

### **Experience ReSound Lab**  
Through live performances, interactive installations, and audiovisual compositions, ReSound Lab invites audiences into a world where technology’s afterlife becomes a source of creativity. In a time of growing e-waste concerns, this project sparks a dialogue on sustainability, innovation, and the musical possibilities hidden within the discarded.  

### Preliminary Performance Agreement
The project already have a preliminary agreement with the [Science & Cocktails](https://www.scienceandcocktails.org/) organization to perform at their events in Copenhagen once the project is mature. The Science & Cocktails events attracts a large audience and the collaboration will give the project a great outreach.

### Courses, Workshops and Tutorials
I am currently in the process of preparing course matriel and workshop material for ReSound Lab. In the future, I will be offering courses and workshops on how to build your own musical instruments from electronic waste. The workshops will be a mix of theory and hands-on practice, where participants will learn about the principles of sound design, electronics, and instrument building. The goal is to empower individuals to create their own upcycled instruments and explore the sonic possibilities of e-waste.
