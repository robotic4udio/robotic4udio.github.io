### Reclaiming PusherStreet â€“ A Sound Installation for Change

With the removal of criminal gangs and drug dealers from PusherStreet, Christiania faces a critical turning point. If nothing meaningful fills the space left behind, history has shown that illegal activity will simply re-emerge, bringing back the same issues that have plagued the area for decades.

This project is part of a larger effort to ensure that something new and constructive takes rootâ€”a cultural, creative presence that transforms the space rather than leaving it empty for old problems to return.

As a response to this challenge, Hjalte Bested Hjorth ([Robotic-Audio](https://roboticaudio.com/)) and Jens Erik Larsen ([JEL Instruments](https://www.jelinstruments.com/)), presents **Resonance of Change**â€”a sound installation designed to bring engagement, interaction, and artistic expression into this renewed public space.

Encased in a glass vitrine, the installation features three identical electro-acoustic instruments, each built around a unique interplay of strings and electromagnetic excitation. At the core of each instrument, a spinning DC motor drives a circular plate of magnets, functioning as an electromagnetic bow. The audience can manipulate the motor speed, subtly influencing which strings resonate and determining the harmonic structure of the resulting sound.

As different motor speeds trigger distinct overtones, the installation becomes a dynamic, evolving soundscape, shaped in real-time by the audienceâ€™s input. This is not a conventional instrument but a self-sustaining sonic ecosystem, inviting exploration at the intersection of mechanics, physics, and musical expression.

By placing this installation in PusherStreet, it merges high-tech experimentation with an urban, organic setting, encouraging passersby to engage with sound in a tactile and intuitive way. A collaborative act of listening and control, the piece bridges the mechanical and the humanâ€”offering a glimpse into the future of interactive sound while actively contributing to the reinvention of Christianiaâ€™s public spaces.

ðŸ”Š The installation is not yet complete, but the vision is clear: to create a space where sound, art, and technology converge, inviting the community to participate in a new chapter of Christianiaâ€™s history. Stay tuned for updates on the projectâ€™s development and installation, and join us in reshaping PusherStreet.
