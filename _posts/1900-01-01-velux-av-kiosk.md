I collaborated with [Bue & Co.](https://www.bueogco.dk/) to create an AV-Kiosk for the VELUX Fondens SynsExpo. The interactive installation is designed to educate visitors about visual impairments and the challenges faced by visually impaired individuals. The kiosk features is built like a tower, with a large screen at the top. Underneath the screen, visitors can find a series of buttons that trigger different movies. On the remaining 3 sides audio headphones are mounted along a button to trigger the audio, see more here: [VELUX Fondens SynsExpo](https://raadomsyn.dk/synsexpo).
