# The competition
UJAM is hosting a film trailer scoring competition, inviting composers to create background music for one of two trailer videos using VP SCORE. The competition can be found here: [UJAM Virtual Pianist Film Trailer Scoring Competition](https://www.ujam.com/blog/score-film-trailer-competition/?srsltid=AfmBOoqb-pijgXiMrsXqC3DJgBVN1SiI9qzzHx-nK2dbyZEWiUIiS1lm).

# My entry
I choose to score the horror trailer, as I have a passion for creating dark and suspenseful music. The
music was composed using VP SCORE for all the creepy piano and several other atmospheric sounds. I aimed to create a very eerie, chilling and suspenseful atmosphere. Unfortunately, I did not win the competition, but I think the submission turned out great. You can listen to the submission below:
