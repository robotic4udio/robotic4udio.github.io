The Energy Game is an interactive learning tool designed to teach children about energy production, distribution, and sustainability. It was developed in collaboration with [Bue & Co.](https://www.bueogco.dk/) 

By simulating real-world energy management tasks, the game offers a hands-on learning experience that highlights the importance of efficient energy use and the environmental impact of energy consumption.

Using an analog display, players take on the role of energy managers, operating a power plant’s furnace, handling combustible materials, prioritizing and distributing energy, and ensuring that the city’s electricity and district heating needs are met.

- The game's values and conditions closely reflect real-life energy management scenarios.
- The Energy Game has been developed in three different versions for district heating plant visitor centers in Næstved, Kokkedal, and Nykøbing Falster.
- The interactive learning stations are designed to engage children and educate them about energy production and sustainability through an immersive, hands-on experience.

Players are challenged to think critically and make decisions that balance energy production with consumption needs, mirroring the complexities faced by real energy managers. This educational tool fosters a deeper understanding of energy systems and encourages sustainable practices among younger generations.

Beyond its educational benefits, the Energy Game also promotes teamwork and problem-solving skills, as players collaborate to achieve common goals. The immersive experience is both fun and informative, making it an effective way to teach essential concepts related to energy and sustainability.
