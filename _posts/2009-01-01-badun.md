From **2005 to 2009**, I was a core member of **Badun**, a Danish **experimental jazz-electronica** group known for its intricate rhythms, deep soundscapes, and genre-blurring compositions. As a **composer, producer, and performer**, I played a key role in shaping the band's **signature fusion** of **organic improvisation** and **electronic manipulation**. We released three critically acclaimed albums in the period: [Badun](https://badun.bandcamp.com/album/badun), [Last Night Sleep](https://badun.bandcamp.com/album/last-night-sleep), and [Tandoori Tentacle](https://badun.bandcamp.com/album/tandoori-tentacle), listen below:

### **My Contributions**  
- **Composition & Sound Design**  
  - Developed **complex, evolving textures**, combining **synthesizers, granular processing, and acoustic instrumentation**, mainly realized in MaxMSP and SuperCollider. 
  - Blended **jazz harmonics** with **glitch-inspired digital manipulations**, pushing the boundaries of experimental electronica.  

- **Production & Studio Work**  
  - Contributed to **three critically acclaimed releases**, helping refine the band’s **sonic identity**.  
  - Focused on **detailed post-production**, including **advanced DSP techniques, unconventional mixing approaches, and live signal processing**.  

- **Live Performance & Improvisation**  
  - Performed at **major festivals and venues** across Denmark and Europe, including **Roskilde Festival 2007**.  
  - Integrated **real-time electronic processing** into live sets, bridging **structured composition** with **spontaneous improvisation**.  


Badun was a playground for sonic exploration—where jazz met machine precision, and where **experimentation and groove coexisted**. My time with the band was pivotal in shaping my approach to **electronic composition**, **live manipulation**, and the interplay between **technology and organic performance**.
