In 2012, Byens Lys was transformed into a surreal, feverish dream of Russian decadence, revolution, and cabaret chaos. Cuckoo’s Nest Cabaret was a wild blend of absurd theater, slapstick comedy, and larger-than-life characters, all wrapped in a deep-red haze of mystery and madness.

The stage pulsed with whimsical performances, dramatic slow-motion fights, and well-timed sound effects—each scene unfolding like a lost reel from a Soviet silent film. From melancholic ballads to riotous vaudeville, the night was a whirlwind of poetry, vodka, and theatrical anarchy, where anything could (and did) happen.
