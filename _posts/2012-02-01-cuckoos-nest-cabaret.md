In 2012, Byens Lys was transformed into a surreal, feverish dream of Russian decadence, revolution, and cabaret chaos. Cuckoo’s Nest Cabaret was a wild blend of absurd theater, slapstick comedy, and larger-than-life characters, all wrapped in a deep-red haze of mystery and madness.

The stage pulsed with whimsical performances, dramatic slow-motion fights, and well-timed sound effects—each scene unfolding like a lost reel from a Soviet silent film. From melancholic ballads to riotous vaudeville, the night was a whirlwind of poetry, vodka, and theatrical anarchy, where anything could (and did) happen.

Characters stepped out of hidden cuckoo doors, each revealing strange and wonderful vignettes—stories of exiled poets, fallen aristocrats, and revolutionaries lost in their own illusions. The audience was swept into a world of mystique, humor, and raw emotional intensity, where the line between performance and reality blurred into an intoxicating dreamscape.

A night to remember, Cuckoo’s Nest Cabaret (2012) was a celebration of the absurd, the poetic, and the unpredictable.
