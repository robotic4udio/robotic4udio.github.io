I collaborated with the Danish artist duo **FOO/SKOU** on innovative sound art installations that integrate **thermal cameras** and the **Bela platform** to create interactive and immersive auditory experiences.

# Project Overview

Our joint projects focused on capturing real-time thermal data from the environment and translating it into dynamic soundscapes. By utilizing thermal cameras, we were able to detect temperature variations caused by human presence or environmental changes. This thermal information was then processed through the Bela platform, known for its low-latency audio processing capabilities, to generate responsive audio outputs.

# Technical Implementation

- **Thermal Cameras**: We employed thermal imaging devices to monitor temperature fluctuations within the installation space. These cameras provided continuous thermal data streams, capturing the heat signatures of participants and ambient conditions.

- **Bela Platform**: The thermal data was fed into the Bela platform, which processed the information in real-time. Bela's high-performance audio processing allowed us to map temperature changes to various sound parameters, such as pitch, volume, and timbre, creating an immediate auditory response to thermal variations.

# Artistic Expression

The integration of thermal cameras and Bela enabled the creation of soundscapes that were directly influenced by the presence and movement of individuals within the space. As participants moved through the installation, their body heat altered the thermal readings, which in turn modulated the generated sounds. This setup fostered a unique interaction between the audience and the artwork, as the sound environment evolved based on human activity and environmental factors.

# Challenges and Innovations

One of the primary challenges was ensuring seamless communication between the thermal cameras and the Bela platform. We developed custom software interfaces to facilitate this data exchange, allowing for efficient processing and sound generation. Additionally, we designed the system to be sensitive enough to detect subtle temperature changes, ensuring that even minor movements or environmental shifts could influence the soundscape.

# Impact and Reception

The resulting installations offered participants an immersive experience where they could perceive the usually invisible thermal aspects of their environment through sound. This fusion of technology and art invited audiences to explore the interplay between their physical presence and the auditory landscape, leading to heightened awareness of their surroundings and their impact on the installation.

Collaborating with FOO/SKOU on these projects allowed us to push the boundaries of interactive sound art, demonstrating how emerging technologies like thermal imaging and platforms like Bela can be harnessed to create responsive and engaging artistic experiences.
