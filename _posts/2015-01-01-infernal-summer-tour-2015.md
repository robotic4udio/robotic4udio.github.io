For Infernal’s **2015 summer tour**, I designed and built a series of **interactive wearables** that fused **technology, light, and performance** into a seamless visual experience. These **custom-engineered stage outfits** allowed the band and dancers to control and synchronize lighting effects in real-time, enhancing the live show’s energy and impact.

## Key Features & Innovations
- **Handheld Remote-Controlled Strobe-Light System**  
  - Custom **wireless** LED strobes embedded in the performers' costumes.  
  - **DMX-controlled** for precise timing with music and choreography.  
  - Performers could **trigger effects on demand**, adding dynamic **flashes and pulses** to the show.  

- **Laser Mohawk System**  
  - A **head-mounted array** of **high-powered lasers**, forming a **futuristic mohawk**.  
  - Integrated **motion sensors** allowed the lasers to **react to movement**, creating a trail effect.  
  - Controlled via **wireless interface**, enabling **color and pattern changes** live on stage.

### **Impact & Reception**  
The **Infernal Wearables** added an electrifying **cyberpunk aesthetic** to the tour, turning the stage into a **living light show**. By combining **real-time control, interactivity, and striking visuals**, these custom wearables set a new standard for **high-tech stage performance**.
