I am an experimental musician, inventor, and sound artist working at the intersection of technology, music, and performance art. My work explores the boundaries between the mechanical and the organic, the composed and the chaotic.

As the creator of Tromleorkestret, a steampunk-inspired mechanical music ensemble, I build and program instruments that fuse acoustic sound with robotics and interactive elements. The music draws inspiration from krautrock, ambient electronics, film scores, and avant-garde performance, creating an immersive audiovisual experience where humans and machines merge.

My artistic practice is driven by a curiosity to manipulate sound, rhythm, and space through self-built instruments and alternative composition methods. I blend traditional musicianship with algorithmic composition, sensor technology, and interactive performances where the audience becomes an active part of the artwork.

Beyond Tromleorkestret, I have composed music for theater, podcasts, and art installations, crafting atmospheric soundscapes that enhance storytelling. My work is a continuous exploration of how sound and technology can shape new artistic expressions, challenge audience expectations, and open doors to unexpected experiences.
