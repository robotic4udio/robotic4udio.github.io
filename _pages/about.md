Hi, my name is Hjalte Bested Hjorth. I am a composer, musician, and creative technologist with a passion for blending art, music, and technology to create immersive, one-of-a-kind experiences. My work is driven by a love for crafting soundscapes that defy genres and inspire wonder, as well as a hands-on approach to building and coding the tools that make these creations possible.

As a composer, I explore a broad spectrum of styles, from cinematic and experimental electronic music to dynamic, interactive performances. My music often combines human expression with mechanical precision, showcasing custom-built instruments like the fire-breathing music machine of [Tromleorkestret](https://tromleorkestret.com). Rooted in creativity and experimentation, my compositions are inspired by everything from psychedelic journeys and film scores to the rich interplay of acoustic and electronic sound. 

My artistic practice is driven by a curiosity to manipulate sound, rhythm, and space through self-built instruments and alternative composition methods. I blend traditional musicianship with algorithmic composition, sensor technology, robotics, and interactive performances where the audience becomes an active part of the artwork.

Beyond [Tromleorkestret](https://tromleorkestret.com), I have composed music for theater, podcasts, and art installations, crafting atmospheric soundscapes that enhance storytelling. My work is a continuous exploration of how sound and technology can shape new artistic expressions, challenge audience expectations, and open doors to unexpected experiences.

Iâ€™m also a DIY enthusiast and creative coder who thrives on turning bold concepts into tangible creations. With a background in robotics and engineering, I design and build robotic instruments, sensor-driven interfaces, and interactive installations. My projects seamlessly combine custom hardware, creative algorithms, and programming to blur the lines between musician and machine. Tools like Bela, MaxMSP, and Open Sound Control (OSC) play a central role in my work, allowing me to shape performances that are as visually captivating as they are sonically innovative.
