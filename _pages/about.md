Hi, I'm Hjalte Bested Hjorth, the owner of Robotic-Audio and the driving force behind [Tromleorkestret](https://tromleorkestret.com). I am a creative technologist, composer, and sound designer with a passion for weaving together art, technology, and storytelling to create unforgettable experiences. With a foundation in robotics engineering and years of multidisciplinary exploration, I specialize in crafting projects where creativity meets technical ingenuity. My work explores the boundaries between the mechanical and the organic, the composed and the chaotic.

My artistic practice is driven by a curiosity to manipulate sound, rhythm, and space through self-built instruments and alternative composition methods. I blend traditional musicianship with algorithmic composition, sensor technology, robotics, and interactive performances where the audience becomes an active part of the artwork.

Beyond [Tromleorkestret](https://tromleorkestret.com), I have composed music for theater, podcasts, and art installations, crafting atmospheric soundscapes that enhance storytelling. My work is a continuous exploration of how sound and technology can shape new artistic expressions, challenge audience expectations, and open doors to unexpected experiences.

If you are interested in collaborating, discussing a project, or simply want to connect, feel free to reach out. I am always excited to explore new ideas, share my knowledge, and collaborate with fellow creatives. Let's create something extraordinary together!
