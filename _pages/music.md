Tromleorkestret – A Mechanical Music Odyssey
Tromleorkestret is my most ambitious and ongoing musical project—an experimental ensemble where self-built robotic instruments, live performance, and interactive technology merge into a unique sonic and visual experience. The music machine at the heart of Tromleorkestret blends steampunk aesthetics with cutting-edge mechanics, featuring a robotic slide bass, an autonomous xylophone, and a fully synchronized percussion ensemble. Sonically, the project moves between psychedelic orchestration, krautrock-inspired grooves, cinematic soundscapes, and pulsating electronic textures. Tromleorkestret has performed at festivals, theaters, and alternative venues across Europe, bringing audiences an immersive blend of sound, movement, and machine-driven magic.

Theater Music – DATA DATA
For the theater production DATA DATA, I composed and developed an interactive music system that responds to the performance in real-time. The show explores the history and evolution of computers, and the music mirrors this theme by integrating sensor-driven soundscapes, algorithmic composition, and live digital manipulation. Using machine learning and embedded DSP systems, I created a dynamic score where sound is directly influenced by movement, light, and performer interaction, making the music an integral part of the storytelling.

Podcast Scores – Science, Storytelling & Atmosphere
I have composed and produced original music for two major podcast series, both blending science communication with immersive sound design:

Lyden af Videnskab – An ambitious podcast series that takes listeners behind the walls of scientific research, making complex topics accessible through sound. My role was to compose atmospheric, emotionally engaging scores that enhance the storytelling, guiding the audience through the depth and wonder of scientific discovery.
The Science & Cocktails Podcast – A podcast where leading scientists dive into existential topics, from quantum physics to the human mind. I created the intro jingle and all background music, crafting soundscapes that support the depth and playfulness of the conversations, helping listeners immerse themselves in the world of science.
